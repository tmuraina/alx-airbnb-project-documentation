# User Stories Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the user stories documentation for the Airbnb Clone backend project. User stories are a fundamental part of agile software development that describe features from the end user's perspective, helping ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering value to users.

## Purpose
User stories serve several critical purposes in our development process:
- **User-Centric Focus**: Keep development efforts aligned with actual user needs
- **Clear Requirements**: Provide unambiguous specifications for development teams
- **Testing Guidelines**: Define acceptance criteria that guide quality assurance
- **Priority Setting**: Help product managers prioritize features for development sprints
- **Communication Tool**: Bridge the gap between business stakeholders and technical teams

## Document Structure

### Main Documentation
- **`user-stories.md`**: The primary document containing all user stories for the Airbnb Clone project

### User Story Format
Each user story follows the standard agile format:
```
As a [user type]
I want [goal/functionality]
So that [benefit/reason]
```

Additionally, each story includes:
- **Unique Identifier**: Format US-XXX for easy reference
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions that must be met
- **Priority Level**: High, Medium, or Low priority classification

## User Story Categories

### 1. User Authentication & Account Management
Stories covering user registration, login, and profile management functionality.

### 2. Property Management  
Stories related to property listing creation, editing, and search functionality.

### 3. Booking System
Stories covering the reservation process, booking management, and status updates.

### 4. Payment Processing
Stories related to secure payment handling and payout management.

### 5. Reviews and Ratings
Stories covering the review system for properties and hosts.

### 6. Admin Features
Stories for platform administration and analytics functionality.

### 7. Technical Requirements
Stories covering non-functional requirements like performance and security.

## Priority Levels

### High Priority (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
These are the core features required for the initial product launch:
- User registration and authentication
- Property listing and search
- Basic booking functionality
- Payment processing

### Medium Priority
Features that enhance the user experience and platform functionality:
- Advanced booking management

## Maintenance and Updates

### Version Control
- All changes to user stories should be tracked through Git commits
- Use descriptive commit messages when updating stories
- Tag major versions for release planning

### Review Process
- Stories should be reviewed by product owners before implementation
- Technical feasibility should be validated by development teams
- Stakeholder approval is required for high-priority stories

### Story Evolution
User stories are living documents that may evolve based on:
- User feedback and testing results
- Technical constraints and discoveries
- Business priority changes
- Market research and competitive analysis
